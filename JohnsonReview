I had an issue downnloading the package and I'm not sure if it's on my end or not. This was the error I recieved (after about 30-min - 1hr 
of download time):
> devtools::install_github("seanstuntz/BAW", build_vignettes = TRUE)

Installation failed: Failed writing body (0 != 824)

Accuracy
I was only able to examine the code of this package. I looked through the functions and everything appears very clean and well documented.
The code is straightforward and well-written, so I would assume it's accurate and works as designed.
I can certainly see where the function's results come from and how they're obtained.

Compilation
As discussed, my pc was unable to download the package successfully. I'm not sure why - maybe something to do with the size? I did as 
instructed in the readme and created a "data" folder first in my directory.

Ease of Use
The readme / documentation make it extremely clear how to use and apply this package. The steps were laid out nicely and clearly so as to 
allow the user a solid guideline for making use of BAW. I was impressed with how well steps 1-6 were written, and I can see how this 
package (provided it can be downloaded successfully) would be an understandable but very informative tool for the user.

Overall, given my limited ability to test the package but how well described and laid out the package code & documentation are, I would give
this project a 48/50. Especially if the download issue is on my end, then I suggest this project recieve full points as it's clear a lot of
hard work and focus was put into making this package informative and simple-to-use.
